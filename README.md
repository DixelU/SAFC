Simple AF Converter (SAFC)
==========================

**Merging completely different midis by completely different ways!**

SAFC is a converter which can merge midis with different PPQs and specify some unusual ones (like 17 or 42); override tempo, override instruments of midis, fix headers (if possible) and events (if possible). Also does volume and pitch mapping, can cut notes to specific range, and transpose a whole MIDI. And new merge technique which is impossible to make manually in Hex editor: **Inplace merge**

It has a big story. First version was literally compilier-like application and dos-like interactive launcher. Then it got a simple OpenGL launcher, yet having the same old basement in the entity of *SAFC.exe*. Now i got it burned, and there's now single app with 2 DLL files with it :)
There's also discord server, where SAF apps were publishing all that time since July/August of 2018: https://discord.gg/CsgEW4P
You can download and read manual right here *(it's just a png file, so anyone anywhere can read it)*: https://github.com/DixelU/SAFC/blob/master/Manual.png It will get updated **only** on major updates, adding new features.
**Support of Windows XP is dropped**

Thanks to all beta testers on SAF server!
