Simple AF Converter (SAFC)
==========================

Allows merging completely different midis by completely different ways!
Also aims at restoring badly damaged/formatted midi files that other editors, players and tools cannot parse!

## Important notice: 
**Currently is being supported as legacy project.** Update including a complete overhaul is ~~coming soon~~ delayed for indeterminate amount of time.

## Feature Manual
