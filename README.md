Simple AF Converter (SAFC)
==========================

**Merging completely different midis by completely different ways!**

It has a big story. First version was literally compilier-like application and dos-like interactive launcher. Then it got a simple OpenGL launcher, yet having the same old basement in the entity of *SAFC.exe*. Now i got it burned, and there's now single app with 2 DLL files with it :)
You can download and read manual right here (it png, so anyone anywhere can read it): https://github.com/DixelU/SAFC/blob/master/Manual.png It will get updated *only* on major updates, adding new features.
The app is compilied for Windows XP 32bit (because there's still people using it, meanwhile being a part of BMC)

Also i need help with adding 64bit version of libraries to it. I think that's all :)
Thanks to all beta testers on SAF server!
