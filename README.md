Simple AF Converter (SAFC)
==========================

**Merging completely different midis by completely different ways!**

There's discord server, where SAF apps were publishing all that time since July/August of 2018: https://discord.gg/CsgEW4P

**Noting that Support of Windows XP was dropped since v1.0**
Also thanks to all beta testers on SAF server!  

You can compile it using MSVC 2017 (and later) by installing freeglut (and glew?) using vcpkg/nuget :)

## Important notice: 
**Currently is being supported as legacy project.** Update including a complete overhaul is coming soon
